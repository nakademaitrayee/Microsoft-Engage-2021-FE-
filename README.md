# Microsoft-Engage-2021
This Application was made as a part of Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021. The web Application named 'Class Activity' is made to increase the collaboration of student and faculty in classroom both - in person classes and in hybrid environment. This application helps the users to create, post and take surveys, which can be attempted by other users, and a Real Time Results Summary is updated as the users choose their options. It helps the faculty to gauge the response of live audience. This is a small attempt to increase the Engagement between students and Faculty :)

# How to Access the Code?
The Code has been divided into two different components:

Frontend part - Angular using Visual Studio Code 2019

Backend part - ASP .NET Core Web API using Visual Studio 2017

The Code for both parts have been uploaded into two different Github Repositories, the backend being in the mster branch of the repo. The link for which have been shared at the time of submission and is shared below as well.
